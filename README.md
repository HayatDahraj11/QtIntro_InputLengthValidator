# QLineEdit Character Limit Warning
A Qt demo project featuring a custom QLineEdit widget that emits a signal when the user's input exceeds a specified character limit, triggering a QMessageBox warning.

This project is a simple demonstration of how to use QLineEdit, QMessageBox, and signals and slots in Qt. It consists of a QLineEdit that emits a signal when the entered text exceeds a certain length, triggering a QMessageBox to warn the user.

## **Objective of this Code**
### The goal of this project is to create a simple Qt GUI application that:

Uses QLineEdit for text input from the user.
Monitors the text input in real-time, and emits a custom signal when the input length exceeds a certain limit.
Responds to the custom signal by displaying a QMessageBox warning to the user.
Through this project, I aim to understand and demonstrate the usage of basic widgets in Qt, such as QLineEdit and QMessageBox, and the concept of signals and slots for real-time inter-widget communication.

## **What I Learnt**
### Through this project, I learnt:

How to use QLineEdit and QMessageBox, two fundamental widgets in the Qt widget toolkit.
How to subclass QLineEdit to add custom behavior.
The usage of signals and slots in Qt, an essential concept in Qt programming, to enable real-time inter-widget communication.
The basics of GUI programming in Qt, including layout management and parent-child widget relationships.


## **Where This Will Help Me**
The knowledge and skills I gained from this project will be invaluable in my journey as a software developer, specifically for developing GUI applications using Qt. Understanding the usage of basic Qt widgets, the signal-slot mechanism, and GUI layout management forms the foundation of Qt programming, and these skills are directly transferable to a wide variety of projects. This understanding will allow me to create more complex and user-friendly applications as I progress in my learning journey.
